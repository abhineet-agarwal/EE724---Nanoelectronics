# EE724---Nanoelectronics
This is my course project report and presentation for the Spring'24 offering of EE724:Nanoelectronics by Prof. Udayan Ganguly. I simulated Band-to-band tunneling in PDSOI and FDSOI MOSFETS to ascertain how to reduce or increase tunneling current for neuromorphic applications.
